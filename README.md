**SpacedR** stands for **Spaced Repetition**.
This project is inspired by an idea about a study technique known as Spaced Repetition.

Spaced repetition is a method of reviewing material at systematic intervals. At the beginning of the learning process, the intervals are spaced closely together (for example, one hour; four hours; one day). As the material is reviewed, the intervals become systematically longer (four days; one week; two weeks).
## Usage 🔎

### 1. Fill in the required information.
Fill in all the information and click submit button.
You will get an email as a reminder to repeat your study material,
after increasing intervals.

### 2. Ace Your Tests
Thrive in your tests by following the method regularly. Remember, hardwork always pays off.
## Working 🤖

#### After filling in all the information correctly, you will receive messages on your given email from time to time, increasing the time intervals.
It works like a reminder app but it is Spaced Repetition.😎
